2.) Press **Windows logo key** + **X**
- Click "Windows Terminal" or "Windows Powershell".\
\
*We call this a* **terminal** *or* **command prompt** *. In this documentation, we use this word to refer to that. It may look a bit techy / complicated. Don't worry.*

- keep the **terminal** open for now till I say you close it.


3.) Now go to your **terminal** and Install [`dhooks`](https://github.com/kyb3r/dhooks), if you haven't already. You can install it by **copying** the below text and **pasting** it in your **terminal**, then finally, hit enter.

*what is a* **clone**?\
*This is literally a clone, it makes a complete copy of the repository*

5.) You're **done**! Please proceed to the **Usage** section below.

## Usage
---Usage is even relatively more simple than the installation procedures---

*I am assuming you still haven't closed your* **terminal** *yet*.

        A moment . . .
```
Now, you're prompted with the following question in your **terminal**:
```
What is the webhook's URL? (We'll just assume you gave a functional and existing webhook URL)> 
```
Now, you are supposed to enter a webhook URL

Once you gave in a webhook URL, in your **terminal** You can send anything you type in that **terminal** as the webhook's name in Discord! Ain't that cool?
